## This is my first blog post!
Hi! My name is Kate Higginbotham, I am a biology major, and I am expected to graduate in 2029!
My goal in life is to become a nurse anesthetist.
My main hobby is that I am on the Memphis Dance Team. I also love to shop, go on walks, and hangout with my dog. 
My favorite subject is science, specfifically chemistry and biology.
