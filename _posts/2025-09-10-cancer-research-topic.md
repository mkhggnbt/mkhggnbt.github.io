My cancer research blog!

I chose to research breast cancer. 


It is the most frequently diagnoised cancer in women. Research estimates that there will be around 316,950 new cases in women and 2,800 cases in men in 2025. 


Breast cancer is usually idenified through mammograms and clincial breast exams. 


Non-modifiable factors like the female gender, increasing age, genetic mutations, family history of cancer, and dense breast tissue cause high risk. Also, motifiable factors like obesity, alcohol consumption, postmenapausal hormone therapy, and reproductive history.


The stages of breast cancer are: 
Stage 0: Carcinoma in situ, non-invasive. 
Stage 1-2: Localized or early invasive cancers. 
Stage 3: Locally advanced. 
Stage 4: Metastatic disease.


There are a few treatments currently available. For example, local treatments like surgrey and radiation therapy and also systematic treatment like hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. 


The average life expectancy is around 5 years, but there are many factors that play into how long or short it will be.
