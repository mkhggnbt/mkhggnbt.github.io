What have we learned from cancer genomics?

Genomic sequencing has showed that cancer forms from accumulated DNA mutations that disrupt normal cell growth and division.

SPNs, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, are single-base changes in DNA. Some drive cancer, while most are harmless.

Driver genes are mutations that give cells a growth advantage and directly contribute to tumor development.

Onco genes are normal genes that, when mutated or overactive, promote uncontrolled cell growth.

Tumor suppressor genes, are genes that normally restrain cell growth, but when inactivated cancer progresses.

I discovered in the articles that most cancers have two to eight driver mutations, with many additional “passenger” mutations.

Tumors evolve through multiple genetic pathways, explaining why cancers vary between patients.

Mutational signatures reveal causes of damage.

Understanding these pathways has led to targeted therapies—treatments aimed at specific driver mutations.

Genomic sequencing has transformed cancer research and treatment by identifying the genetic blueprint behind tumor behavior.

It enables personalized medicine, where treatment is tailored to each tumor’s mutation profile.
